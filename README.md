# Back

“A confidential way to back builders, build on Ethereum, live on Base.”

Every great idea starts small. A single builder, a quiet creator, a developer with a vision. They don’t always have investors or institutions behind them—but they have people. People who believe. People who want to help. People who say, “I’ll back your build.”

Back was born from that spirit.

We saw how traditional platforms exposed everything—who donated, how much, how often. In a world where privacy is shrinking, builders deserve a way to receive support without giving up their freedom. That’s why Back uses stealth addresses on Ethereum to protect every transaction. Each time someone contributes, a new address is created—confidential, unlinkable, and secure.

But we didn’t stop there. Builders need more than privacy. They need a home. That’s why Back lives on Base—fast, affordable, and builder-friendly. With Ethereum’s trust and Base’s accessibility, we built a platform that is both secure and usable for everyone.

At its core, Back is not just about crypto, code, or transactions.
It’s about belief.
It’s about giving people the power to support the builders they trust—quietly, safely, and meaningfully.

Because when you back a builder, you don’t just fund their project.
You help shape the future they’re building.
